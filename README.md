✈️ Smart Assistant for the Deaf and Mute on Airplanes Using AI

🧩 The Problem
Deaf and mute passengers often face challenges in communicating with the cabin crew and understanding voice announcements and safety instructions. This reduces the quality of their travel experience and may impact their safety and comfort onboard.

💡 The Innovative Solution
A smart AI-powered assistant designed specifically for deaf and mute passengers.
It can be integrated into seat screens or offered as a mobile app.
The assistant provides real-time translation between sign language and text/speech and vice versa, enabling smooth communication between passengers and the crew, and allowing passengers to easily understand instructions and announcements.

🛠️ Technologies Used
Computer Vision to detect and interpret hand gestures

Natural Language Processing (NLP) for understanding and translating text

Text-to-Speech (TTS) and Speech-to-Text (STT) for converting between voice and text

Deep Learning models for accurate sign language recognition

User Interface built with React Native or Flutter for cross-platform compatibility and ease of use

🎯 Expected Impact
Significantly improves the comfort and satisfaction of deaf and mute travelers

Empowers passengers with a more independent and safe flying experience

Promotes inclusive air travel services in line with international accessibility standards

Reinforces airlines’ commitment to innovation and social responsibility

🌐 Future Vision
This solution will begin as a mobile application and expand to be embedded directly into airplane seat screens to support deaf and mute passengers worldwide.
